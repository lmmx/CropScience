JournalCrop-n-Print
===================

A few Javascript files to add "crop &amp; print" options to the Acrobat Help menu for various academic journals.

Add them to <code>root\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Acrobat\Privileged\11.0\Javascripts</code> and they'll run at start-up (adding options into the Help menu).

The above file path may differ if you're using an earlier version or Mac/Linux though I'm sure they'll be similar.

The journals included are just those I read most of - I'll be looking to update with more soon, and you're more than welcome to chip in.

Any questions / recommendations / comments, my email is naivelocus@gmail.com.
